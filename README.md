##### 1 - Fork Repo with all branch don't click main branch only option
##### 2 - Git pull

```
git checkout development
```
##### 4 - Pull all new changes

if you already done the latest pull recently you don't need to do it

```
git pull origin main
```

##### 5 - Commit your Changes and Push to the development branch and add a pull request

if it's looks valid and good we will commit else we will reject
